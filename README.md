# TS-Wallshoes
Wallshoe-plugin for Tekla Structures (Finnish environment)

Plugin for Tekla Structures to make inserting wallshoes into precast panel-elements somewhat easier.

Plugin inserts wallshoes, cuts for the shoes and the bolts to the selected panel. For wallshoes can be used any components from
the component catalog, but cuts will be added only to EB_ASL* models by default. The dimensions for different kinds of EB_ASL* shoes
are hard-coded to make automatic cutting possible.

All included source code is written by myself (except included libraries in .NET environment ofcourse).
